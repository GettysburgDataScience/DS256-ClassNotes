    "For this project, you'll be writing a hybrid tutorial/blog post: a blog post in the sense that you'll be telling a story and a tutorial in the sense that you'll be showing and explaining how you did the work.\n",

    "**TIPS**\n",
    " - Writing should be clear, concise, and grammatically correct. \n",
    "    - I recommend writing your initial draft in a MS Word or Google Docs. \n",
    "    - Use spelling and grammar checker. \n",
    "    - Proofread your work and have a friend give it a final read.\n",
    " - Code should be clear and correct.\n",
    "    - Any submitted code should run without errors.\n",
    "    - After your code runs and produces the outputs you want, clean up unnecessary code and/or outputs.\n",
    "    - Ask a friend, PLA, or Prof Roth to look over your code.\n",
    " - Figures should be annotated and understandable on their own.\n",
    "    - Your whole story should be understandable from just your figure.\n",
    "    - Consider what kind of graph(s) would work best for your data story.\n",
    "    - Add informative titles, axes labels, annotations, legends, etc.\n",
    "    - Make aesthetic decisions about size, linewidth, color, etc.\n",
