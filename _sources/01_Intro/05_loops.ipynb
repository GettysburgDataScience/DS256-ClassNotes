    "## Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. This is useful if you need to perform the same set of actions on several (tens or maybe hundreds) of different items in some container (e.g. loading files from a list of filenames, parsing text into sentences or clauses, extracting specific data that meet some criteria from a larger set). Once you understand loops, you'll find they're incredibly useful for automating tedious analyses. BUT for large data and complex operations, loops can get very slow; so for many data science use cases, we try to find ways to avoid using loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main kinds of loops, common to most programming languages are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - while loops - perform a block of code as long as some condition holds true\n",
    " - for loops - perform a block of code a set number of times\n",
